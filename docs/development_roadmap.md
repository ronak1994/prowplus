  - [ ] Tasks collection
  - [ ] Messages collection
  - [ ] Invoices collection
- [ ] Define indexes for performance optimization
- [ ] Create relationships between collections
- [ ] Document the schema design

## Phase C: Backend API Development with Node-Express Boilerplate (Days 13-17)

- [ ] Setup Node-Express boilerplate from [hagopj13/node-express-boilerplate](https://github.com/hagopj13/node-express-boilerplate)
- [ ] Configure environment settings
- [ ] Implement models based on MongoDB schema design
- [ ] Create API endpoints:
  - [ ] Authentication routes
  - [ ] User management routes
  - [ ] Projects routes
  - [ ] Tasks routes
  - [ ] Communication routes
  - [ ] Payments routes
- [ ] Implement validation using Joi
- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Implement middleware for authentication and authorization

## Phase D: API Testing (Days 18-19)

- [ ] Create test suites for all API endpoints
- [ ] Set up test environment
- [ ] Write unit tests for models and services
- [ ] Write integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Perform load testing
- [ ] Document API with Swagger

## Phase E: Frontend-Backend Integration (Days 20-24)

- [ ] Connect frontend to real API endpoints
- [ ] Replace mock data with actual API calls
- [ ] Implement proper error handling
- [ ] Add loading states for API interactions
- [ ] Create API service layer in frontend
- [ ] Implement authentication flow
- [ ] Test all integration points

## Phase F: Final Polish and Deployment (Days 25-30)

- [ ] Comprehensive testing of all features
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Fix any remaining bugs
- [ ] Prepare deployment pipeline
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Final QA
- [ ] Prepare production deployment

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Critical Path Features** (Must Have):
   - User authentication
   - Projects listing and management
   - Tasks assignment and tracking
   - Team member profiles
   - Basic communication

2. **Important Features** (Should Have):
   - Invoice generation
   - Calendar integration
   - Document management
   - Advanced filtering and search

3. **Nice to Have Features**:
   - Timeline/Gantt chart
   - Advanced analytics
   - Integrations with third-party tools

## AI Development Focus Areas

For each phase, AI development will focus on:

1. **Frontend Phase**:
   - UI Component Generation
   - Template Customization
   - Responsive Design

2. **MongoDB Schema Phase**:
   - Schema Structure Optimization
   - Index Strategy

3. **Backend API Phase**:
   - Route Implementation
   - Validation Logic
   - Security Best Practices

4. **Integration Phase**:
   - API Service Creation
   - State Management
   - Error Handling

## Technical Debt Management

To avoid accumulating technical debt during AI-assisted development:

1. Document all assumptions made during development
2. Flag areas needing refactoring at end of each phase
3. Maintain a list of patterns that should be consistent across modules
4. Schedule regular code review sessions

By following this roadmap, we'll ensure structured progress through the ProwPlus CRM development while maximizing AI assistance effectiveness.
